    <div class="content" id="info">
        <h3>Playing field</h3>
        <p>The playing field has the following position:</p>
        <img class="contain600px" src="../Media/Images/defaultPos.png" alt="Defautl position">
        <p>Elements on board are named:</p>
        <p>Pawn/Bishop = Wall</p><img class="contain100px" src="../Media/Images/Pieces/SideWallWhite.png" alt="sideWall">  
        <p>Rook = Goal Post</p><img class="contain100px" src="../Media/Images/Pieces/GoalPostWhite.png" alt="GoalPost">   
        <p>Grid = Goal/Net</p><img class="contain100px" src="../Media/Images/Pieces/goal.png" alt="Goal">
        <p>This pieces cannot be moved or captured by any player or piece. Walls are different because they can affect the movement of the ball. <em>(Section: "The ball")</em></p>
        
        <h3>Player pieces</h3>
        <p>Each player controls 2 type of pieces:</p>
        <p>2 supporters (KNIGHT = SUPPORTER)</p><img class="contain100px" src="../Media/Images/Pieces/SupporterWhite.png" alt="supporter">
        <p>1 captain (QUEEN = CAPTAIN)</p><img class="contain100px" src="../Media/Images/Pieces/CaptainWhite.png" alt="captain">
        <p>Supporters move as knights.</p>
        <p>Captains move as queens.</p>
        <p>They can capture opponents pieces.</p> 
        <p>They cannot move into a goal. The starting position of pieces is:</p>
        <img class="contain600px" src="../Media/Images/startPos.png" alt="Defautl position">

        <h3>The ball</h3>
        <p>This piece is neutral. We can use KING = BALL.</p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
            <img class="contain100px" src="../Media/Images/Pieces/ball.png" alt="Ball" style="display: inline">
        </div>
        <p>The ball moves when a piece captures it. It can move up to 3 squares, where it can bounce along the way.</p>
        <p>From walls it bounces reverse diagonally if bounced diagonally from opponents side else it bounces in any direction.</p>
        <p>From goal posts it bounces reverse direction if bounced orthogonally else it bounces any direction.</p>
        <p>From captains it bounces reverse direction.</p>
        <p>From supporters it bounces in any direction.</p>
        <p>The ball is the only piece that can enter into a goal.</p>
        <p>The balls starting square is dependent who is on turn (image shows only white on turn. Otherwise for black on turn the ball mirrors diagonally):</p>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            Players usually play 50 moves per player where they try to make as many goals as possible. 
            After each goal the board resets.
            Player with most goals wins.
